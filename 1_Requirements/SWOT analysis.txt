SWOT ANALYSIS:

STRENGTH:

Trackers generate more electricity than their stationary counterparts due to increased direct exposure to solar rays. This increase can be as much as 10 to 25% depending on the geographic location of the tracking system.
Non-use (and disturbance) of land which conserves the local environment.
Easy to erect and faster deployment.
WEAKNESS:

High waves and salt water possibly damage the solar panels over time.
Lack of experience and knowledge.
This system works only in Warmer climate.
OPPORTUNITIES:

Solar trackers provide significant advantages for renewable energy. With solar tracking, power output can be increased by about 30 to 40 percent. The increase in power output promises to open new markets for solar power.

THREATS:

Cost concerns and lack of financial resources.
Maintenance and repair.
Untested Technology for long run.
